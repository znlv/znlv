# 👨‍💻 About Me:

- 💻 I was born and raised in **The Netherlands**, where I developed a keen interest in technology from an early age.
- 📚 I am **self-taught**, learning everything from programming languages to networking, cryptography, and security concepts through hands-on projects and challenges.
- 🔧 I have actively contributed to **CrowSploit**, an open-source hacking tool designed for penetration testing and security research. This tool provides a wide range of attack vectors for learning about exploits in a controlled and ethical manner.
- 🔐 My main focus is on **ethical hacking**—helping organizations discover vulnerabilities and improve their defenses by simulating real-world attacks.
